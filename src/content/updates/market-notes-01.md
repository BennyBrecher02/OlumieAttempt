This note is written as a *framework*, not a prediction. In markets where the cost of capital is higher and underwriting has less room for error, we focus on a few recurring questions:

## 1) Where does the downside actually live?
We separate **operating downside** (volume, margin, execution) from **structural downside** (capital stack, covenants, refinancing needs). A business can be operationally strong and still fragile if the structure is brittle.

## 2) What must be true for stability?
We look for a credible path to stability that doesn’t depend on a single optimistic assumption. Good plans include:

- conservative baseline cases
- measurable leading indicators
- clear decision rights and escalation paths

## 3) What can improve without forcing strategy?
We prefer opportunities where tangible improvements are available through execution rather than reinvention—better reporting cadence, pricing clarity, working capital discipline, procurement hygiene, and governance.

## Closing thought
Resilience is rarely a single initiative. It’s usually a system: structure + cadence + accountability.
