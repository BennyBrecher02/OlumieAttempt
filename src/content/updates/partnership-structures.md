Partnerships work best when the structure is understandable on day one and still holds under stress.

## What we aim for
- **Clear decision rights**: who decides what, and when
- **Simple reporting**: the minimum data needed to run the partnership well
- **Defined escalation paths**: how disagreements get resolved

## Avoidable failure modes
Over-engineering is a real risk: too many metrics, too many committees, and too little accountability.
