This is a **placeholder** for an annual communication format.

## Themes we care about
 - underwriting discipline
 - governance and cadence
 - alignment across stakeholders
## What we try to do consistently
We avoid complexity where it doesn’t add decision-quality. The goal is clarity, repeatability, and accountable execution.
