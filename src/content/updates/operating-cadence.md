When execution is the goal, the biggest unlock is often *cadence*: a consistent way of seeing the business and making decisions.

## A simple approach
- Weekly operating review: a short set of KPIs, variances, and actions
- Monthly financial review: cash, working capital, and key risks
- Quarterly planning: priorities, resources, and accountability

## Why it matters
Cadence converts “opinions” into “signals” and gives teams a shared language for what good looks like.
