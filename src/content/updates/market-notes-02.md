Complex situations tend to fail for predictable reasons: unclear constraints, fragile structures, or execution plans that can’t survive normal volatility.

## What we try to make explicit
- **Constraints**: timeline, approvals, stakeholders, and what “good” looks like.
- **Structure**: where refinancing risk sits and what happens if the timeline slips.
- **Execution**: which levers matter most in the first 30–90 days.

## A practical test
If the plan can’t be summarized as a small set of measurable actions and decision points, it’s usually not ready for capital.
