This is a **placeholder** intended to demonstrate structure and filtering.

## What we believe matters in Q2
- identifying stability signals early
- protecting downside through structure and cadence
- making execution measurable

## What we’re watching
Liquidity and timing tend to matter more than narratives when conditions change quickly.
